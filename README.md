# CodeTimeLens

CodeTimeLens is a blazing-fast, privacy-respecting developer productivity tool built in Rust. It monitors your coding sessions, tracks file changes, correlates with Git commits, and gives you deep insights into how you code — all while running locally and efficiently.

Whether you’re a solo hacker, freelancer, or engineering lead, CodeTimeLens helps you answer:
	•	How much time did I actually spend on this feature?
	•	What files took the most effort?
	•	What are my most productive hours?
	•	Can I get a better sense of where my dev time goes?

All locally, with no external dependencies or cloud sync. Ideal for developers, freelancers, researchers, and productivity nerds.
